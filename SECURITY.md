# Security Policy

This document stipulates the details on how one may use this system to manage and diagnose vehicle data. if there is a breach in data or activities, this breaks the security policy and 
causes harm to user data and experience. As of now the system is in its early beta versions, meaning the database is self sponsored and the way the system works will depend soley on the
user, take care of your data and do not under any circumstances attempt to break the project because you might find yourself disatisfied with the results of its simplicity. Within the 
system are the basics on how a diagnostics and management system should be, mainstream code base will follow later on if the project is feasible enough to be worth the thrill to advance
to a modern interface with a sleek design and fluid interface.

## Supported Versions

The security policy covers this first beta of the program as it only caters for major functions that are required to work without dealing too much with the interface and how it snaps on
different resolutions and operating systems.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report an issue, clearly describe the cause, what you were doing and where it showed up, there is an issue section on the project where I can view them and check them off as fixed when
I find time to resolve the errors. if there is an issue I cannot handle, it will be left as so because of the lack of vast experience in python at the moment but one way or the other will
be solved via AI. If there is a need to help in developing the program, fork the project and create a pull request to aid in fixing or adding a feature which would be very helpful to the 
prject because most tools like this are mainly out there with a high price, so we're here to build open source programs to make things easier for everyone.
